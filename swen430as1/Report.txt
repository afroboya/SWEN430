Assignment One

###################
Real - Completed
###################
The hardest part about this was that Int is a subtype. Initially I tried converting any int that was assigned to a real to a double.
However this became particularly difficult when assigning variables and within arrays.
I instead choose to handle that case when comparing, doing operations etc.

###################
ForEach - Completed
###################
The hardest part about this was ignoring that the variable needed to be assigned, as we know for the loop to run that it will be assigned.
Initially I tried assigning a dummy value, but this only worked if the dummy value matched with the expected type. Instead I do a specialty check if it is a for-loop

I had trouble with: ForEach_Valid_6.while

As this not actually valid, the variable xs is of type int[] and iterates over a collection of int[]. I made some of my own tests for this case.

###################
doWhile - Completed
###################

This one was not to difficult, however I duplicated the while class and renamed it, unfortunately I forgot it would also rename any instance where while was called.
So my doWhile methods were not being called. I was also confused as to why doWhile_Invalid_2.while was invalid. However I eventually figured out it was because r was not assigned.
I created a few tests, primarily double checking breaking out worked, when it was put as the last statement(so everything else was definitely assigned)


###################
TryCatch - Completed
###################

This one was easily the most difficult. The try catch aspect itself wasn't as hard as catching java errors and understanding what the error code represented. I am still unsure how to tell the difference
between // negative length exception and // assertion failure, as they both produce assertion failures. I still do not understand if the "code" was randomly assigned. I looked a whiley documentation but could not see anything about exceptions and codes
